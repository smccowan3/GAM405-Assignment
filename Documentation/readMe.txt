WELCOME TO MY GAME

The aim is to find all the ways to die in the level. There are five in the scene presented.

Please note the following controls:

WASD for movement
Space bar for jump
Tab to respawn
E to break stuff 

Jump/break stuff functions are unlocked on level

The quit application buttons in menu and victory screen do not work in Unity Editor but would work in the final build
